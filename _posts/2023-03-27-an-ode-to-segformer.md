# An ode to the internal functionality of SegFormer :joy:

    In the heart of SegFormer lies a wondrous design,  
    A framework that's efficient, robust, and fine.  
    It's built upon two modules that work in tandem,  
    To produce semantic segmentation with precision and aplomb.  

    The first module is an encoder, a hierarchical transformer,
    That generates multi-level features with great fervor.
    It uses Mix Transformer encoders, from B0 to B5,
    Each tailored and optimized for semantic segmentation to thrive.

    These encoders capture both local and global information,
    Using Mix-FFN to replace traditional positional encoding's limitation.
    They extract coarse and fine features with great care,
    And pass them on to the decoder for further repair.

    The second module is a decoder, an All-MLP delight,
    That fuses multi-level features with great insight.
    It takes the output of the encoder as its input,
    And upsamples it back to the original image resolution without dispute.

    The decoder produces a segmentation mask with Ncls dimensions,
    Where each pixel is assigned a semantic category with great intention.
    This allows users to customize SegFormer for their specific need,
    Predicting different types of masks depending on their application indeed.

    Together, the encoder and decoder work in harmony,
    To produce semantic segmentation masks with great accuracy.
    SegFormer is a framework that's efficient, robust, and powerful too,
    A testament to the wonders that deep learning can do.
